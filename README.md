# Hey, I'm Sudhanshu 👋

I'm a C++ developer, and I spend most of my time building systems where speed actually matters — low-latency infrastructure, real-time processing, that kind of thing.


## Main interests

- Real-time and event-driven systems
- Concurrency, threading, lock-free designs
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Distributed systems and caching

## Projects

**[Live-Strategy-Backtester-II](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Live-Strategy-Backtester-II)** — A backtesting engine for trading strategies, built with latency in mind.

**[Flash-Cache](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Flash-Cache.git)** — Custom distributed cache focused on fast response times.

**[Tracker](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Tracker)** — Tracking My Progress.

C++ (17/20) is my primary language. I work with std::thread, atomics, lock-free queues, custom allocators, TCP/UDP sockets, shared memory — the usual low-latency toolkit. 
CMake for builds, perf/VTune for profiling.
