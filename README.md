# Hey, I'm Sudhanshu 👋

I'm a C++ developer, and I spend most of my time building systems where speed actually matters — low-latency infrastructure, real-time processing, that kind of thing.

## What I work on

I'm drawn to problems where microseconds count: trading systems, caching layers, event-driven architectures. Most of my work involves figuring out how to make things faster — whether that's through lock-free data structures, smarter memory management, or just writing cleaner code that doesn't get in its own way.

**Main interests:**
- Real-time and event-driven systems
- Concurrency, threading, lock-free designs
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Distributed systems and caching

## Projects

**[Live-Strategy-Backtester-II](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Live-Strategy-Backtester-II)** — A backtesting engine for trading strategies, built with latency in mind.

**[Distributed-Cache-System](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Distributed-Cache-System)** — Custom distributed cache focused on fast response times.

**[Tracker](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-S3/Tracker)** — Tracking My process.

C++ (17/20) is my primary language. I work with std::thread, atomics, lock-free queues, custom allocators, TCP/UDP sockets, shared memory — the usual low-latency toolkit. 
CMake for builds, perf/VTune for profiling.
